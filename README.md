# Vue Modern Boilerplate

[![vue-modern-boilerplate](media/header.gif)](README.md)

A tweak-friendly starter project skeleton to build [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org) single page apps or sites. Created through [Vue CLI 3](https://cli.vuejs.org/) and built on top of [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), it uses modern JavaScript syntax with [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) features via [babel](https://babeljs.io/) to start integrating the best tools in the **frontend ecosystem**.

**Note:** _This is a personal vue.js starter boilerplate, it may not be a good approach for your project(s)._

## Development experience

- **Full flexibility.** Tweak the config of each open source tool
- **Optimized for most apps.** Reliable development server featuring _live-reload_, _hot-module-replacement_, _lint-on-save_, _static assets handling_ & _css extraction_, ...
- **Pre-processor support.** _Pug_, _Scss/Sass_, _Less_, _Stylus_ or _TypeScript_ compilation, just to name a few, powered by `vue-loader`. You can even use **CSS Modules** inside components with `<style module>`
- **Modern build tools.** Build the `.vue` components as native web components shipping native ES2015 code to modern browsers that support it with auto fallback to a legacy bundle for olders browsers that do not
- **Improved website/app loading performance.** Production-ready bundles optimized with minification for JS/CSS/HTML, auto vendor chunk splitting for better caching, HTML injection, offline mode with a Service Worker, PWA-ready features like ms-browserconfig, the manifest, a mobile-friendly meta-viewport or the app favicons. The goal is **a Lighthouse/PageSpeed score of 90+/100** ðŸ’‰
